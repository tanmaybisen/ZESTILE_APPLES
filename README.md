# ZESTILE_APPLES
A composite model for industrial utilization that automates apple bruise detection in an indestructible way.

Project aims at automating the identification of the apple bruises using Hyperspectral imaging technology and the latest model of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
The traditional methods of bruised apple detection with RGB images are not very efficient as color and texture may not be the dominant feature for apple bruise identification.
Different apple species were scanned under the Resonon Pika NIR-320 HSI Camera.
For testing and validation purposes the lab-based chemical analysis results were used.
The results of the research study would assist in establishing a standard bruise detection system for industrial utilization.
The test results showed that the proposed detection model could recognize the apple bruises with 0.95 (mAP) and the accuracy of the validation system was found to be 97.56%.
